Commit Message Rules

A standard commit message includes a concise subject line (max 50 characters, capitalized, imperative mood, no trailing period) followed by a detailed body separated by a blank line explaining what, why, and how the change was made.

Basic Structure

Part 1: Subject

Type: Commit category (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
Scope: Affected area (e.g., frontend, backend, API, auth) (optional).
Description: Short summary of the change, no more than 50 characters.

Rules:
- Capitalize the first letter.
- Use present-tense imperative verbs (e.g., "Add" instead of "Added").
- Do not end the subject line with a period.

Part 2: Blank Line
Separate the subject from the body with a single blank line.

Part 3: Detailed Body
Explain what was changed, why it was necessary, and how it was implemented.
Wrap each line at 72 characters for readability.
